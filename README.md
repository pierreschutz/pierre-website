This repository contains the Nuxt directory of my personnal website hosted on https://pierreschutz.github.io :

This website has been in 24 hours the 7 October 2019.

It has been made from scratch using Vue.js and Nuxt.js

Feel free to use it as a template for your own website !

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
